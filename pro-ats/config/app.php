i have a Workflow review it once

Step 1: Candidate Onboarding Candidates enter the system through CV inbox, manual entry, or contact managemet . Each candidate is assigned a unique code and a recruiter. The initial status is "new."

Step 2: Candidate Screening The assigned recruiter reviews the candidate profile, updates missing information, uploads documents, and changes the status to "qualified" if suitable or "rejected" if not a fit. Activity is logged automatically.

Step 3: Job & Client Setup Clients are onboarded with basic details. Jobs are created with detailed requirements and linked to clients. Jobs have a status workflow: draft → open → filled → closed.

Step 4: Candidate Submission (Unified): use only Submissions module with this simplified workflow:

Status
Description
Next Actions
Pending
Candidate identified for job, not yet submitted
Submit to client, Withdraw
Submitted
Candidate profile sent to client
Client review, Schedule interview
Interviewing
Client is conducting interviews
Record feedback, Make aggrement, Reject
Offered
Client has made an aggrement
Accept, Decline, Negotiate
Placed
Candidate accepted offer and started
Close submission
Rejected

Record reason, Archive
Withdrawn
Recruiter withdrew submission
Record reason, Archive


Step 5: Interview Management When a submission moves to "Interviewing," the system sends notifications to the recruiter. Interview dates and client feedback are recorded in the submission record.

Step 6: Offer & Placement When an offer is made, the system records the offer details ( start date). If accepted, the status changes to "Placed" and the job's openings count is decremented. If the job is filled, its status changes to "Filled."

Step 7: Reporting & Analytics A new reporting module provides insights including submissions by status, time-to-fill by job and placement rate by recruiter.
